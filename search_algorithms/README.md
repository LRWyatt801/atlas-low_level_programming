# Search Algorithms

This project is to teach me about search algorithms.
- How to write them
- What they are
- Different types
- What is the best one based on use

## Linear Search

Search through an array one element at a time.
This method is O(n) on worst case.
Meaning that the time complexty of it grows linearly with its size.
Effective for small data size.

## Binary Search
